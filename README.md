Implementation of a Deep Active Inference agent, accompagnying the article “Deep Active Inference” (Citation as published). The code depends on Python 2.7 and Theano for tensor operations.

To install the required components on Ubuntu, you can follow: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install_ubuntu.html

To sample from the trained model saved in deepAI_demo_best.pkl, just run
python sample_deepAI_demo.py

To train a new agent, run
python deepAI_paper.py

To plot the progress, run
python plot_log_deepAI_paper.py

To sample from the trained model, run
python sample_deepAI_paper.py
