Scripts used to create the figures in Kai Ueltzh√∂ffer, "Deep Active Inference" (add Citation when published).

The scripts are written in Python 2.7, using Theano for tensor operations.

Just run the scripts in the console by typing: python scriptname.py

The following scripts were used to create the individual figures:

Figures 1 and 2: plot_definitive_potential.py
Figure 4: plot_log_figure_paper.py
Figure 5: sample_deepAI_paper_nonlin_action_figures_insight.py
Figures 6, 7 and 8: sample_deepAI_paper_nonlin_action_figures.py

Supplementary Figure 1: plot_log_figure_no_proprioception.py
Supplementary Figures 2 and 3: sample_supplement_no_proprioception.py
Supplementary Figure 4: plot_log_figure_only_proprioceptive_action.py
Supplementary Figures 5 and 6: sample_supplement_only_proprioceptive_action.py
